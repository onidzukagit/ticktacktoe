# TickTackToe game
My first game made on C++ (Actually first).

To play you must input cell to step. For example: "1:1". You can also write like this: "111". I mean that symbol between "stroke number" and "collumn number" no matter.
This game will be upgraded and updated, thats all in future!

My goals:

~~-custom player symbol.~~

-user log in.

-leader table.

-random first player step.

-good formated output (field rewrite).

# TickTackToe game
My first game made on C++ (Actually first).

To play this game you must do steps. In my game steps do by input a cell coordinate, which will be marked by your symbol, if she's not busy by other player. First coordinate is stroke, or "y coordinate". Next is separate symbol which can be anyone, and last coordinate is collumn, or "x coordinate". For example, step on left up corner will be like that: "1:1", where ':' is separate symbol. It can be latter or number, anything.  

~~-custom player symbol.~~

-user log in.

-leader table.

-random first player step.

~~-good formated output (field rewrite).~~
